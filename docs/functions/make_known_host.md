# function: make_known_host

"make_known_host generates a known host entry using the specified arguments.
The generated entry can use the modern privacy preserving hostname hashing procedure if the "hash_salt" argument is not null.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  public_key = "AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJz12DGyEg2G8BylpI/02ZSgLMj+yGq7rXB/lRGjuzL8"
}
resource "random_id" "salt" {
  byte_length = 20
}

output "known_host_entry_nohash" {
  value = provider::ssh2vsock::make_known_host(local.public_key, "example.com", null)
}

output "known_host_entry_with_hashed_hostname" {
  value = provider::ssh2vsock::make_known_host(local.public_key, "example.com", random_id.salt.b64_std)
}
```

## Signature

<!-- signature generated by tfplugindocs -->
```text
make_known_host(key string, hostname string, port number, hash_salt string) string
```

## Arguments

<!-- arguments generated by tfplugindocs -->
1. `key` (String) The "key" argument specifies the SSH public key of the known host.
The key must be encoded in the SSH wire format for public keys and encoded using standard base64 encoding (with padding).
1. `hostname` (String) The "hostname" argument specifies the hostname of the known host.
This hostname will be included in the known host entry, either as provided or in a hashed format, depending on the nullity of the "hash_salt" argument.
1. `port` (Number) The "port" argument specifies the port on which the known host SSH service listens.
1. `hash_salt` (String, Nullable) The "hash_salt" argument specifies the salt to use if the known host hostname should be privacy protected.
If this argument is null, the hostname is not hashed.
If non-null, the value of this argument is expected to be a 20-byte value, encoded using standard base64 encoding (with padding).
